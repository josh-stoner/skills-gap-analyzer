Joshua Stoner presents a very strong candidate for the EPD Enablement Manager role, with a high overall match score of 85. His extensive experience in Program Management and Systems Leadership, coupled with strong technical skills in automation (Google Apps Script, Zapier, API connections) and content creation (Articulate 360, Docebo, Udemy), directly aligns with several key requirements. His data visualization skills will be valuable for data analysis. While 'Onboarding', 'Learning & Development', 'Process standardization', and 'Metrics tracking' are not explicitly listed, his background in instructional design, program management, and systems leadership strongly suggests he possesses these competencies.
