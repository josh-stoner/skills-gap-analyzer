    "recommendation": "Joshua Stoner presents a very strong candidate for the EPD Enablement Manager role, with a high overall match score of 85. His extensive experience in Program Management and Systems Leadership, coupled with strong technical skills in automation (Google Apps Script, Zapier, API connections) and content creation (Articulate 360, Docebo, Udemy), directly aligns with several key requirements. His data visualization skills will be valuable for data analysis. While 'Onboarding', 'Learning & Development', 'Process standardization', and 'Metrics tracking' are not explicitly listed, his background in instructional design, program management, and systems leadership strongly suggests he possesses these competencies. These are considered critical gaps that would need to be explored further during an interview to confirm his direct experience and approach. His user context of 10 weekly hours available for 2 weeks suggests a need for a role that can be managed effectively within this timeframe, which his program management experience should support. Overall, Josh is a highly recommended candidate who warrants further consideration."
